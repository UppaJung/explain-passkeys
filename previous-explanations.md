## Explanations that only tell you what a passkey replaces (passwords):

From the [Chromium team](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/12/introducing-passkeys-in-chrome.html) (retrieved 2022-12-09)
> Passkeys are a significantly safer replacement for passwords and other phishable authentication factors. 

From the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) (retrieved 2022-12-09)
> Passkeys are a password replacement that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a userâ€™s devices.

If you can't tell a user what something is, but only tell them what it replaces, you should not be surprised when they are not confident enough to adopt it.
