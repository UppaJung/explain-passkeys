# Prior work explaining passkeys

(Boldface throughout added for emphasis.)

## Explanations that only tell you what a passkey replaces (passwords)

From the [Chromium team](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/12/introducing-passkeys-in-chrome.html) (retrieved 2022-12-09)
> Passkeys are a significantly safer **replacement** for passwords and other phishable authentication factors. 

From the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) (retrieved 2022-12-09)
> Passkeys are a password **replacement** that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices.

## Explanations that actually try to answer the question "what is a passkey?"

From Apple's [iPhone User Guide](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/iphone/iphf538ea8d0/ios) (retrieved 2022-12-09):
> A passkey is a **cryptographic entity that’s not visible to you**, and it’s used in place of a password.

Since the only invisible entitities I've previously read about are deities, I can't help but wonder if Apple is implying the existence of cryptograhic deities. It would explain why I've also read work in which characters exlaim "Holy S*@%!"
